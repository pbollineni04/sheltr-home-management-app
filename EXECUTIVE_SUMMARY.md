# Sheltr - Executive Summary for Pitch Deck

## One-Liner
**Sheltr is the all-in-one home management platform that helps homeowners track expenses, manage tasks, organize documents, and plan maintenance—all in one place.**

---

## The Problem

### Customer Pain Points
- **Fragmentation**: Homeowners use 5-7 different apps for home management (budgeting, tasks, document storage, calendars)
- **Manual Data Entry**: Receipts, invoices, and bills tracked in spreadsheets or paper
- **Forgotten Maintenance**: Missing warranty renewals, overdue HVAC service, unmaintained home systems
- **Invisible Spending**: Home expenses scattered across multiple credit cards and bank accounts
- **Information Loss**: Important documents stored in multiple places, hard to find when needed

### Market Validation
- 85+ million US homeowners
- 400+ billion annual home spending
- 62% of homeowners use 3+ different tools for home management
- Average homeowner spends $3,000-5,000/year on maintenance and improvements

---

## The Solution

### What is Sheltr?
A single, beautifully designed web app that consolidates all home management needs:

1. **Expense Tracker** - Auto-sync bank transactions via Plaid, categorize spending
2. **Task Manager** - Maintenance schedules, seasonal checklists, shopping lists
3. **Document Vault** - Store & organize warranties, insurance, deeds, receipts
4. **Smart Alerts** - Notifications for expiring warranties, overdue maintenance
5. **Timeline** - Historical view of all home events and spending

### Key Features (Live)
- Bank account integration (Plaid) for automatic expense sync
- Smart categorization for home-specific expenses
- Seasonal task bundles (spring cleaning, fall prep, etc.)
- 13-category document organization with expiration tracking
- Real-time sync across devices
- Beautiful dark mode UI
- Mobile-responsive design

---

## Why Sheltr Wins

### Competitive Advantages
1. **Only unified home management platform** - Competitors are fragmented (budgeting tools, contractor marketplaces, design apps)
2. **Plaid bank integration** - Automated transaction import (unique in category)
3. **Purpose-built for homeowners** - Not generic, specifically designed for home operations
4. **Modern tech stack** - React, TypeScript, Supabase → fast, scalable, maintainable
5. **Feature-rich MVP** - 10 major features, 5 fully built and live, 5 code-complete

### Defensibility
- Data moat: 85M+ homeowners, personalized home maintenance history
- Network effects: Family sharing, contractor marketplace
- High switching costs: Consolidated data across expenses, tasks, documents
- Plaid partnership: Integration depth advantage
- B2B2C channels: Real estate agents, property managers, insurance companies

---

## Market Opportunity

### Market Size
- **TAM**: $85M households × $50 annual ARPU = $4.25B
- **SAM**: 20M tech-savvy homeowners × $100 ARPU = $2B
- **SOM (Year 1)**: 5K users × $100 = $500K

### Growth Drivers
1. **Housing market activity** - 6M+ home sales annually
2. **Home improvement boom** - Post-pandemic demand sustained
3. **Digital-first generation** - 65% of millennials use personal finance apps
4. **API economy** - Plaid enables new fintech categories
5. **DIY home management** - Rising interest in property ownership optimization

### Competitive Landscape
- **Direct competitors**: NONE - no other platform combines all 5 functions
- **Adjacent competitors**: Angi (contractor marketplace), YNAB (budgeting), Houzz (design)
- **Market position**: We're creating a new category, not competing in existing ones

---

## Business Model

### Monetization Strategy
**Freemium SaaS** (not yet implemented)
- **Free tier**: Dashboard, basic tasks, limited documents (5), manual expense entry
- **Pro tier**: $9.99/month - Unlimited documents, Plaid sync, advanced analytics, export
- **Premium tier**: $24.99/month - Everything + prioritized support, contractor marketplace

### Pricing Logic
- LTV calculations: Assume 5-year customer lifetime, 6% monthly churn → $500-1,000 LTV
- Price point: $9.99/mo supports $15-30 CAC with 20-30:1 LTV:CAC ratio
- Expansion revenue: Contractor marketplace (20-30% take rate on service bookings)

### Revenue Projection (5-Year)
```
Year 1: 5,000 users × $0 = $0 (free launch, acquisition phase)
Year 2: 50,000 users × $8 avg/mo × 15% paid = $4.8M ARR
Year 3: 200,000 users × $10 avg/mo × 20% paid = $24M ARR
Year 4: 500,000 users × $12 avg/mo × 24% paid = $72M ARR
Year 5: 1M users × $14 avg/mo × 28% paid = $168M ARR
```
