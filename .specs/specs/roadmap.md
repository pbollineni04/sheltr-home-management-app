# Sheltr Strategic Roadmap

**Last Updated**: November 11, 2025
**Context**: Post-landing page redesign, pre-soft launch planning

## Current Situation

### Timeline
- **Soft Launch Target**: Few weeks (aspirational, dependent on finals schedule)
- **Full-Time Focus**: Starting next month after graduation (December 2025)
- **YC Application**: Skipped this round intentionally, targeting next cycle

### Active Work
- **Friend Working On**: Onboarding flow
- **Recently Completed**: Landing page redesign with truthful messaging

### Energy/Capacity
- Already did significant work today (landing page overhaul)
- Finals coming up - limited bandwidth
- Post-graduation: Can dedicate much more time

## Priority Focus Areas

### High-Value Pre-Launch (Before Soft Launch)

#### 1. Analytics & Tracking Setup
**Priority**: Critical before launch
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Status**: Not started

Tasks:
- Research Supabase analytics capabilities
- Evaluate what user tracking is available
- Implement basic page view tracking
- Set up conversion funnel tracking (signup → first expense → first task)
- Dashboard for monitoring user behavior

**Why Important**: Can't improve what you don't measure. Need baseline metrics before launch.

#### 2. Document Vault Improvements
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Status**: Needs scoping

Questions to Answer:
- What specifically bothers you about current vault?
- UI/UX issues?
- Organization/search functionality?
- File preview capabilities?
- Tagging/categorization?

**Next Steps**: Define specific pain points and improvements

#### 3. Feature Functionality Polish
**Priority**: High but broad
**Effort**: TBD
**Status**: Needs scoping

Areas to Consider:
- Dashboard: What feels incomplete?
- Expenses: Any UX friction?
- Tasks: Want to rework (but complex - see Future Work)
- Timeline: Any gaps?
- Vault: See #2 above

**Next Steps**: Audit each feature for critical UX issues

### Future Work (Post-Finals/Post-Graduation)

#### 4. Tasks Rework
**Priority**: High (you really want this)
**Effort**: Large
**Status**: Deferred due to energy/time

**Defer Until**: Post-finals or post-graduation when you have more bandwidth

#### 5. Utilities Feature
**Priority**: Aspirational/Strategic
**Effort**: Very Large (requires API research + implementation)
**Status**: Research phase

**Blockers**:
- Need to research utility company APIs (PG&E, Edison, etc.)
- Understand SmartMeter data access requirements
- Determine API availability and data formats

**Strategic Planning Option** (30min - 1 hour):
- Research utility company API landscape
- Create utilities feature specification
- Map out technical requirements
- No coding, just planning for future

**Defer Until**: Post-graduation for serious implementation

## Decision Framework

### For Right Now (Today)
Given energy level and time already invested today:

**Option A: Quick Win (1-2 hours)**
- Analytics/tracking setup
- Immediate value, critical for launch

**Option B: Medium Polish (2-3 hours)**
- Document Vault improvements
- After defining specific scope

**Option C: Strategic Planning (30min - 1 hour)**
- Utility API research
- Sets up future work, no coding pressure

### Pre-Launch Checklist (Next Few Weeks)
- [ ] Analytics and tracking implemented
- [ ] Critical UX issues resolved across all features
- [ ] Onboarding flow complete (friend's work)
- [ ] Document Vault polished (if prioritized)
- [ ] Landing page live and tested
- [ ] Basic error monitoring/logging in place

### Post-Graduation Focus (December 2025+)
- [ ] Tasks feature rework
- [ ] Utilities feature research → spec → implementation
- [ ] Advanced features and polish
- [ ] Marketing and growth initiatives
- [ ] Prepare for next YC application cycle

## Open Questions to Revisit

1. **Document Vault**: What specific improvements would make the biggest impact?
2. **Feature Functionality**: Which feature has the most critical UX gaps?
3. **Analytics**: Beyond basic tracking, what metrics matter most pre-launch?
4. **Utilities**: Which utility companies should we target first? What APIs exist?

## Notes

- Landing page is now truthful, problem-first, with real screenshots
- Git history is clean and organized
- Ready to push to production when desired
- Focus shifting from marketing materials to product functionality
- Timeline is flexible based on finals and graduation schedule

**When to Review This Document**:
- Before starting next work session
- When planning weekly priorities
- After finals (to reprioritize for full-time work)
- When feeling stuck on what to work on next
